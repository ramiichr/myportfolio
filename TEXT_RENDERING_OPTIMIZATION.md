# Text Rendering Optimization Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Font Loading Delays (FOUC - Flash of Unstyled Content)

**Problem:** Google Fonts were loading with `display: "swap"` causing visible text flashing

**Solution:**

- Changed font display to `"block"` to prevent text flash
- Added direct font stylesheet loading instead of client-side event handlers
- Implemented fallback fonts with proper font-family declarations
- Added font load detection with `fonts-loaded` class via script and client component
- Created FontLoader component for better font loading detection

### 2. Theme Provider Hydration Issues

**Problem:** ThemeProvider returned `null` during initial mount causing layout shifts
**Solution:**

- Removed the `null` return during hydration
- Enabled theme provider immediately with `disableTransitionOnChange` only during hydration
- Added critical CSS to prevent theme transition flashes

### 3. Language Provider Hydration Issues

**Problem:** Language switching caused text to disappear and reappear
**Solution:**

- Simplified language provider to avoid returning different content during SSR/hydration
- Reduced transition opacity from 0.5 to 0.8 for smoother transitions
- Smooth transition duration (0.2s for better visual flow)

### 4. Framer Motion Animation Delays

**Problem:** Complex animations with long durations and delays
**Solution:**

- Reduced animation durations to 0.2s for smooth feel
- Reduced initial animation delays from 0.2s to 0.1s
- Less dramatic initial states (opacity 0.8 instead of 0, smaller movements)
- Faster spring animations with higher stiffness and lower damping

### 5. Data Loading Text Flash

**Problem:** Text content dependent on API responses causing empty states
**Solution:**

- Added loading placeholders with skeleton animations
- Implemented Suspense boundaries for better loading states
- Pre-rendered content structure to prevent layout shifts

## CSS Optimizations:

### 1. Text Rendering Performance

```css
html {
  text-rendering: optimizeSpeed; /* Prioritize speed over quality */
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  text-rendering: optimizeSpeed;
  font-display: block;
}
```

### 2. Font Loading Strategy

```css
/* Prevent text flash during font loading */
html:not(.fonts-loaded) {
  font-family:
    system-ui,
    -apple-system,
    sans-serif !important;
}

html.fonts-loaded {
  font-family:
    "Inter",
    system-ui,
    -apple-system,
    sans-serif;
}
```

### 3. Transition Optimizations

```css
/* Faster, smoother transitions */
[data-language] * {
  transition: opacity 0.15s ease-out;
}

* {
  transition:
    background-color 0.15s ease,
    color 0.15s ease,
    border-color 0.15s ease !important;
}
```

## Performance Measurements:

A performance measurement script has been created at `/scripts/measure-performance.js` that tracks:

- First Paint (FP)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Font loading time
- DOM Content Loaded time

## Results Expected:

1. **Eliminated text flashing** during initial page load
2. **Faster perceived performance** with reduced animation delays
3. **Smoother theme transitions** without text disappearing
4. **Better language switching** with minimal visual disruption
5. **Reduced Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** with proper placeholders
6. **Faster Time to Interactive (TTI)** with optimized font loading

## Browser Compatibility:

All optimizations are compatible with modern browsers and include fallbacks for:

- Safari (font-display and backdrop-filter)
- Firefox (scrollbar styling)
- Chrome/Chromium (performance API)

## Next Steps:

1. Monitor Web Vitals in production
2. Consider implementing font subsetting for further optimization
3. Add Resource Hints for even faster loading
4. Consider implementing critical CSS extraction for larger deployments
